# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** Kaitlin Taylor

**Assignment:** Week 2 - Use Agent mode

**Expected time:** About 15 minutes to complete this reflection

## Key interactions

Review your chat history with Agent and document 2 meaningful interactions—ones where you learned something new or had to adjust your prompt.

### Interaction 1: [Brief title, e.g., "Dragon Update"]

**My prompt:**

> [commit package.json to github with the message "dragon update".]

**What happened:**

[The agent ran the dragon code to say "I love npm scripts!" next to 
a dragon.]

---

### Interaction 2: [Creating a new ReadMe]

**My prompt:**

> [Write a new README that includes:

A level 1 heading with your project title [Make animals talk]
A level 2 heading for a section [Json content]
Your favorite cowsay output in a code fence: ```text
 _______
< Hello >
 -------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
]

**What happened:**

[The agent created and updated my readMe file]

---

## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

[It explains the syntax of Json code. I did not edit this file. ]

---

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### Agent mode for setup (required)

[How was using Agent for npm setup different from typing commands yourself? What are the advantages? Any downsides?

Using agent for NPM is a faster process. Honestly no downsides, because you can always go and edit the code yourself. ]

### What you learned (required)

[What was the most useful thing you learned in this assignment? This could be about npm, Agent mode, documentation, or anything else.

Learning more about JSON syntax, and how to use various
parts of JSON code]

### Optional questions

Answer any of these that interest you:

- Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful?
- Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages? How did they compare to your own?
- What npm concepts would you like to learn more about?

## Optional

**Approximate time spent working with AI:** [e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour]

**Favorite cowsay creature:** [Which one and why?]
